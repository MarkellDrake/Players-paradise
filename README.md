# Player's Paradise

## Goal
Create an application where you can search a videogame and it displays the name of the game, the box art, the console and the rating, as well as a trailer, gameplay, or review video that the user can click on if they would like to learn more.

## User Story
As a Gamer, I want a  website where I can search for video games information
So that I can make an  informed purchasing decision

## Installation
None

## Challanges
The RAWG API was very generous with the amount of requests allowed, but took some trial and error to figure out all the quirks.
The YouTube API was less forgiving with request amounts so the API key had to be updated constantly. If the deployed site is not loading videos, the daily quota might be hit, but will reset daily. The YouTube API was also quite challenges, especially with embedding videos. We had to dive deep into the documentation and forums to resolve our issues.
